  * Quantization on deep neural network: Proposed a novel exponent-only floating-point quantized neural network (EOFP-QNN) to quantize the model. Achieved a 4x compression rate.
  * Acceleration on a compressed DNN: Proposed IA-Net, which can simultaneously compress the model size and accelerate the inference process by replacing the floating-point multiplier with an integer adder without performance degradation.
  * Bio-signal processing: Cooperated with the otolaryngologist and speech therapist at Far Eastern Memorial Hospital in Taiwan. Combined deep learning and machine learning techniques to develop the disease classification system by the patients’ voice.
  Taught electronic engineering and researched semiconductor physics.
