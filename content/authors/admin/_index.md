I am **Yi-Te Hsu**, currently an M.S. Computer Science student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). 
Before coming to JHU, I was a research assistant at [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en) conducting research on speech processing with [Dr. Yu Tsao](https://www.citi.sinica.edu.tw/pages/yu.tsao/index_en.html). I mainly focused on model compression and acceleration for deep neural networks. 

I also collaborated with [Prof. Frank Rudzicz](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frank/index.html) at [University of Toronto (UofT)](https://www.utoronto.ca/) and [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) as a visiting researcher. I worked on healthcare projects for detecting pathological voice and identifying Alzheimerâ€™s disease. 

My interests include speech processing, AI and ML. I am excited about applying these techniques to solving the real-world problems.



*I am looking for 2021 full-time opportunities!*
