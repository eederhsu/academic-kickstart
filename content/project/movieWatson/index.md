Our ***MovieWatson*** is a light movie recommendation system for each person. Most of the movie recommendation systems need the registration of their members. In addition, these recommendation systems will recommend the movie by the historical information of this user. These are lack of flexibility. Therefore, ***MovieWatson*** used instant rating, and the users can also receive the recommendation by their interests at the moment. Meanwhile, ***MovieWatson*** does not need users to register as a member, it saves complex registration procedures. 


***Features:***

* Built a movie recommendation system that instantaneously captured user preference without needing user data history.
* Utilized collaborative filtering system as well as database retrieval method to provide recommended 10 movies.
